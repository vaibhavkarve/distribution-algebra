"""This module defines abstract classes for statistical distributions.

We define 2 types of distributions. The first is
`UnivariateDistribution`. Most named statistical distributions we
learn about in a statistics course (Normal, Beta, Uniform, etc.) can
be thought of as instances of `UnivariateDistribution`.

Second, we define a statistical distribution whose parameter might not
be known. Such a distribution is tracked by keeping around a really
large sample. We name this a `VectorizedDistribution`. In many cases,
working with vectorized distributions is easier since it allows us to
apply algebraic operations to them.
