# distribution-algebra
A python package that implements an easy-to-use interface for random
variables, statistical distributions, and their algebra.

This Python package is brought to you by [Vaibhav Karve](https://vaibhavkarve.github.io).

`distribution-algebra` recognizes Normal, Lognormal, Beta and Poisson
distributions. The package implements an interface to easily construct
user-defined Univariate distributions as well Vectorized distributions.

Additional features include:
- A `plot` function for probability density/mass function plotting.
- A `draw` function for drawing random samples of specified size from a given distribution.
- Addition and multiplication operations defined directly on distributions:
  - For example, the sum of two Normal (Poisson) distributions is Normal (Poisson).
  - The product of two Lognormal distributions is Lognormal.
  - The sum of two arbitrary univariate distributions is expressed as a Vectorized distribution.

# Installation and usage

To get started on using this package,

1.  Istall Python 3.10 or higher.
2.  `python3.10 -m pip install distribution-algebra`
3.  Use it in a python script (or interactive REPL)

    ```python
    from distribution_algebra import Beta, Lognormal, Normal, Poisson

    x: Normal = Normal(mean=1.0, var=9.0)
	y: Normal = Normal(mean=1.0, var=16.0)

	assert x + y == Normal(mean=2.0, var=25.0)
    ```
